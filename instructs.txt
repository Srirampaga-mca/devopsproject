MERN Stack Todo Application
This project is a simple Todo application built with the MERN stack:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing todo items.

Express.js: A backend web application framework for Node.js.

React.js: A frontend JavaScript library for building the user interface.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for the server.

Project Structure
You'll need to create a project structure like this:

/mern-todo-app
â”œâ”€â”€ client/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ App.jsx       <-- You'll replace the default with this file
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json    <-- You'll replace the default with this file
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Todo.js         <-- Place this file inside
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                <-- You'll create this file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        <-- Place this file in the root
â””â”€â”€ server.js           <-- Place this file in the root

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm: Download & Install Node.js

MongoDB: You need a MongoDB database. You can use a local installation or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas to get a free connection URI.

Backend Setup (Server)
Navigate to the root directory of your project (/mern-todo-app).

Place the generated files: Put package.json, server.js, and the models folder (containing Todo.js) in this directory.

Create an environment file: Create a new file named .env in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string to it:

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Replace the placeholder with your actual connection string.

Install dependencies: Open your terminal in the root directory and run:

npm install

Start the server:

npm run dev

The backend server will start on http://localhost:5000.

ðŸš€ Frontend Setup (Client)
Create the React App: In your terminal, from the root directory (/mern-todo-app), run the following command to create the React client folder.

npx create-react-app client

Replace files:

Replace the contents of client/package.json with the package.json file provided for the client.

Replace the contents of client/src/App.js with the App.jsx file provided. You may need to rename the file from .js to .jsx.

Install client dependencies: Navigate into the new client directory and install the necessary packages.

cd client
npm install axios

Set up Tailwind CSS (for styling):

Install Tailwind CSS by running these commands inside the client directory:

npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init

Configure your tailwind.config.js file:

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

Add the Tailwind directives to your src/index.css file:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

Start the client: From the client directory, run:

npm start

The React application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000. You can now add, view, complete, and delete your todos!
